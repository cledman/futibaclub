# Futiba Club

This project is part of the [Devpleno](http://devpleno.com/) course and consists of a website that the users can create groups for friends rate their soccer teams.

We mainly use [React](https://reactjs.org), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) was used to record the data from the form.
